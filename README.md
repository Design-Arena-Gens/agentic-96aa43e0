# Veo 3 Video Demo — Alien Arrives on Earth (Next.js)

Hindi web demo to generate an “alien arrives on Earth” cinematic video using Google Veo (with a safe demo fallback). Built with Next.js (App Router) and deployable on Vercel.

## 📋 Description

This project contains code generated by an AI assistant to fulfill specific requirements. The generated code includes modern web technologies and follows current best practices.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- A modern web browser

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-name>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Copy environment file (optional, only needed if you have a Google API key):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # then edit .env and set GOOGLE_API_KEY
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the console).

If no `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is provided, the app runs in demo mode and returns a sample video so the UI remains fully functional.

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (see `.env.example`):

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_genai_key_here
# Optional model override:
GOOGLE_VEO_MODEL=veo-3
```

Notes:
- The API route is at `/api/generate`. If `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is missing, it will return a mock sample video URL.
- When a valid key is present, it attempts to call Google’s Generative AI SDK for Veo-compatible models.
